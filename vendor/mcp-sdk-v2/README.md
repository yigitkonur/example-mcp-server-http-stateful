# Vendored MCP SDK v2 Artifacts

These tarballs were packed from the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 pre-release source:

- Repository: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk
- Commit: `c4ee360aac7afd2964785abac379a290d0c9847a`
- Date: 2026-02-20

Included packages:

- `modelcontextprotocol-server-2.0.0-alpha.0.tgz`
- `modelcontextprotocol-node-2.0.0-alpha.0.tgz`

Why vendored:

- v2 split packages are pre-release, and availability can differ across npm environments.
- Vendoring keeps this boilerplate and generated projects reproducible.
